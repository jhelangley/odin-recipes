    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1/2 pound penne pasta</li>
        <li>1/4 cup unsalted butter</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>4 cups milk</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon seafood seasoning, such as Old Bay®, or to taste</li>
        <li>3 cups shredded sharp white Cheddar cheese</li>
        <li>1 (5.2 ounce) package Garlic & Herbs Soft Spreadable Cheese, such as Boursin®, broken into chunks</li>
        <li>salt to taste</li>
        <li>1 dash hot sauce, or to taste</li>
        <li>2 ounces lump crab meat</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook pasta in the boiling water, stirring occasionally, until tender yet firm to the bite, about 12 minutes. Drain; keep warm.</li>
        <li>Meanwhile, add butter and flour to a saucepan over medium heat. As butter melts, whisk flour to create a roux. Slowly pour in milk, whisking constantly, and cook for 3 to 4 minutes. When milk comes to a boil, turn off heat. Add Old Bay seasoning, Cheddar cheese, and Boursin cheese, and whisk until cheeses are melted and sauce is smooth. Season with salt and hot sauce to taste.</li>
        <li>Stir in drained pasta; gently fold in crab meat.</li>
        </ol>
